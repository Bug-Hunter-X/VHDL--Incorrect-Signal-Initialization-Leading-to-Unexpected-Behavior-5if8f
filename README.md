# VHDL: Incorrect Signal Initialization

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VHDL related to incorrect initialization of an internal signal. The bug is that the signal is initialized with 'x', an uninitialized value, instead of a specific binary value.  This can lead to unpredictable simulation results and synthesis issues.

The `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.vhdl` file provides the corrected code with a proper initialization.

## Bug Description
The signal `internal_reg` in `bug.vhdl` is initialized to "x"00. This is problematic because 'x' represents an undefined value.  Depending on the simulator and synthesis tool, this could lead to different behavior, potentially causing unexpected outputs or synthesis errors. 

## Solution
The solution involves initializing `internal_reg` to a well-defined value (e.g., "00000000"). This ensures that the signal has a predictable starting value.
